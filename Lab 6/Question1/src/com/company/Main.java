/*
To solve this question, there is a condition declared above, which tells that
if the stage is less than 10 and stuweight is less than 40, then throw an exception
There are 2 ways to solve it. Firstly, either make the changes on the input and change the variables,
secondly we can change the required/checking function requirements.
